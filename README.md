# Financial Data Prediction Competition Solution

## Introduction
This repository contains the solution for the Financial Data Prediction Competition by Synnax. The competition provided a dataset consisting of real financial indicators of 2030 publicly traded companies over 11 consecutive quarters. We fetched the 6th rank on the public leaderboard which accounted for 53% of the test data and 9th on the private and final leaderboard which accounted for 47% of the test data.

## Solution Description
The solution in this repository presents a predictive model developed to forecast the financial data points for the last reported quarter of the companies in the dataset. The model utilizes machine learning algorithms or other predictive techniques to generate accurate predictions for the target variables.

## File Description
- financial-performance-prediction-final.py : Python file containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction generation.
- train-5.csv: training dataset.
- test.csv: test dataset.

## Usage
To use this solution:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the train and test datasets listed in `train-5.csv` and `test.csv`.
3. Run the `financial-performance-prediction-final.py` notebook to generate predictions for the financial data points.

## Note
This solution is part of a Kaggle competition submission and is intended for educational and demonstration purposes. It showcases one approach to solving the Financial Data Prediction Competition task.
